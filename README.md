Topological Neural Network (TNN) is a physics-inspired deep learning framework that unifies neural computation with the laws of energy conservation and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) field closure.
Instead of optimizing weights in isolation, the TNN maintains internal energetic balance between activation energy and field coupling — creating self-stabilizing learning dynamics that behave more like a physical system than a traditional neural net.

Designed for research and experimentation, this repository provides a stand-alone PyTorch implementation that can be dropped into any workflow as a plug-and-play model or extended into new architectures.
It’s simple enough for direct use in Jupyter notebooks, yet expressive enough to explore topological dynamics, stability metrics, and field-based learning across any dataset.

## Overview

The **Topological Neural Network (TNN)** is a new physics-inspired deep-learning architecture that integrates **magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) closure equations** directly into the learning process.
Instead of optimizing only by gradient descent, the TNN enforces an internal **energy–coupling equilibrium**, producing a self-stabilizing field that maintains numerical and topological balance across layers.

Conventional neural networks treat neurons as static mathematical functions.
The TNN treats each hidden activation as a **dynamic field element** whose energy and curvature evolve under conservation laws analogous to those found in physical systems.

This implementation is the first **stand-alone open-source release** of the model core: a fully reusable module that can be dropped into any PyTorch project and trained on any dataset or domain.

 Key Concepts

| Term              | Description                                                                                   |       |                                              |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Energy (E)**    | Average squared activation magnitude — represents field energy density.                       |       |                                              |
| **Coupling (C)**  | Divergence of activation gradients — magnetic or curvature coupling between field components. |       |                                              |
| **Stability (S)** | Absolute difference                                                                           | E − C | — a scalar indicator of dynamic equilibrium. |
| **MHD Closure**   | Feedback law that drives E → C through a corrective coupling term added to the forward pass.  |       |                                              |

The network evolves so that E ≈ C ≈ constant, meaning its internal field behaves like a **closed Hamiltonian system**.
In experiments, this produces smooth convergence and stable learning without batch-norm, clipping, or adaptive damping.

 Architecture Summary

```
Input  →  Linear(784→512)  →  ReLU
        →  Linear(512→512)  →  ReLU
        →  Linear(512→10)
              ↳  +  MHD closure correction
```

The closure correction applies a small term
  `Δ = λ * (E − C) * tanh(output)`
where λ controls topological feedback strength (`lambda_topo` parameter).

 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<RRG314>/topological-neural-net.git
cd topological-nn
pip install torch matplotlib
```

---

 Usage

```python
from topological_nn import TopologicalNeuralNetwork
import torch, torch.nn as nn

# Initialize
model = TopologicalNeuralNetwork(input_dim=784,
                                 hidden_dim=512,
                                 output_dim=10,
                                 lambda_topo=1.0)

# Dummy input (e.g., flattened 28×28 image)
x = torch.randn(32, 784)
y_pred = model(x)

# Access current field diagnostics
print(model.get_topological_state())

# Standard training loop example
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
loss_fn   = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = loss_fn(y_pred, torch.randint(0,10,(32,)))
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

Because it’s completely dataset-agnostic, you can plug any tensor input into it — tabular, vision, or sequence embeddings — and the topological terms will self-adjust.

 Outputs & Diagnostics

Every forward pass computes three values:

```python
{
  "Energy":    float,   # E
  "Coupling":  float,   # C
  "Stability": float    # |E - C|
}
```

These can be logged to TensorBoard or CSV for analysis.
In stable regimes, `Energy ≈ Coupling` and `Stability → 0`, forming a numeric signature of topological equilibrium.

## 🧠 Scientific Context

Traditional neural networks minimize loss over parameter space.
The TNN augments this with **field-based self-regulation**, introducing a *topological conservation principle* derived from MHD and Hamiltonian mechanics:

[
\frac{dE}{dt} = -\frac{dC}{dt}, \qquad S = |E - C| \rightarrow 0
]

This mechanism keeps gradients bounded and preserves internal energy symmetry — effectively building physics into the optimization layer itself.
It creates a bridge between numerical learning and physical law, offering new directions for:

* Dynamically stable learning systems
* Physics-informed AI
* Self-normalizing and noise-resistant architectures

## 🧠 Philosophy

The TNN is designed not just as a model, but as an experiment in **field-driven intelligence** — an attempt to make neural learning follow the same conservation laws that govern physical systems.
Where ordinary networks “learn patterns,” a TNN *balances forces*.
This release is a step toward unifying machine learning with topology, energy, and geometry.
